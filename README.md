# football-match-predictor

Started out with data from the premier football league. The data is cleaned and preped for ML algorithms. After this I created an initial model with only a few predictors and a target.
I used a random forest model to train it on those predictors. I then imporoved the accuracy of the predictions by generating more predictors and training the model again using rolling averages.
I finally further improved the accuracy by looking at both sides of the matches. I eneded with a 67.5% accuracy.

# Looking forward 
I could look to improve the data by scraping and using more of it (i only used 2 seasons). I could also use more of the colums offered by the data like venue and referee. I could also try different Ai models like neural network or some other that can identify non-linear algorithms.
